# LeNet-5-from-Scratch

This repo is a demo for multiclass classification for visual data and display various basic tasks such building a model and saving it, acquistion of data, training and evaluating the performance etc.
Classifying handwritten digits using LeNet 5 architecture, written from scratch in PyTorch, is what I considered trivial task in machine learning. 

The average acurracy is 98.63%.

Note: This is a small side project when I started fresh for machine learning 2 years ago.

I have included conda environment requirements and jupyter notebook for demo.
